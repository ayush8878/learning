1)What is the use of log ?
Ans: How many 2 need to be multiplied to  get 64 as a result? 
answer is 6 so 2^6=64 which can also be written as log2(64)=6.
2)Handshaking Lemma
Ans:Sum of odd degree vertex is always even in a undirected graph
M deg(v)=2|E|
where M rep summation v is vertex and E is edges.
Stats of Handshaking Lemma:
1)In  a k-ary tree every node has either 0 or K child using below property
L=(k-1)*I +1
where L=Leaf
I=internal node 
Case 1: Root is Leaf(Only one node)
Case 2:
Sum of degree of leaves+sum of internal node except root+roots degree=2*(No of nodes -1)
2) In Binary Tree Always
L=I+1
where L=Leaf
I=internal node
